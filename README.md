# Using an LCD to display information from Objects in Space

## Requirements:

* LCD library (might come with the arduino but im big noob so no idea) https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal

* The ArduinosInSpace library (which does most of the legwork, thank you!!) https://bitbucket.org/pjhardy/arduinosinspace/src/master/

* An arduino, some wires and an LCD display. The LCD library does all of the software but you'll need to figure out how to connect it

This is a list of some of the possible requests from the unofficial OiS wiki https://oiswiki.sysadninjas.net/wiki/Serial_Requests

This example was done on a 16x2 display but should be easy enough to edit to change the location of stuff to support a bigger/smaller screen.

First time using an arduino so be kind 

Thanks to smt for helping me out with figuring out the base code https://twitter.com/smt923
