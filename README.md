# Using an LCD to display information from Objects in Space

## Requirements:

* Follow this to get Objects in Space set up to communicate with your arduino https://oiswiki.sysadninjas.net/wiki/Getting_started_with_hardware

* LCD library (might come with the arduino but im big noob so no idea) https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal

* The ArduinosInSpace library (which does most of the legwork, thank you!!) https://bitbucket.org/pjhardy/arduinosinspace/src/master/

* An arduino, some wires and an LCD display. The LCD library does all of the software but you'll need to figure out how to connect it

This is a list of some of the possible requests from the unofficial OiS wiki https://oiswiki.sysadninjas.net/wiki/Serial_Requests

This example was done on a 16x2 display but should be easy enough to edit to change the location of stuff to support a bigger/smaller screen.

Make sure you exit to the main menu before uploading any changes or it wont update. Possibly might need to hit your reset button on the main menu no matter what but not sure.

First time using an arduino so be kind 

Thanks to smt for helping me out with figuring out the base code https://twitter.com/smt923
